    "# Solving the Four-Player Intransitive Dice Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Intransitive (or Non-transitive) dice are dice which have a greater than 50% chance of winning in some kind of cyclical (rock-paper-scissors-like) pattern. For instance, Die A beats B, B beats C, and paradoxically enough, C beats A.  It seems unusual that such a thing could exist but, funnily enough, it can, and is [well documented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intransitive_dice)\n",
    "\n",
    "So the question is how many dice do you need such that you can you find a die that will always beat some selection of dice by some other players?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have only one friend.   Any set of three intransitive dice will work, because if they pick C, you pick B, etc.  But what about if you have two friends?  The same set will force you to lose to one and win to the other.  But we want to beat both!  If you try adding in two dice to bring the total to five dice, you'll find that again, it's possible for your friends to pick two dice that have no common winner.  (In rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock terms, think if they pick Spock and scissors. Rock, paper, and lizard lose to Spock, scissors, and scissors respectively.)\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be shown, however, that from a set of seven properly constructed dice, one can pull a die that beats any combination of two dice.  Thus the three-player game is solved with oscar's dice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we make some combination that solves for four players?  Yes! (although I call that p=3 because I'm just interested in the adversarial players)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the three-player version for some hints. Oscar's dice are three-sided dice (or doubled-up six-sided dice) that have some interesting properties.  I'll substract one off of all the faces to zero-index it, and show only the three-sided die version:"
